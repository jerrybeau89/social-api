# social-api
This is a repo that will contain code for a social media api


## Description
Social API is a backend application that accepts user input via insomnia. User input can be URL queries, JSON data, or a combination of the two. Social API allows users to create a user in which the user can post thoughts, reactions to thoughts, and manipulate created data such as updating, creating or deleting the data.
